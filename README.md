## MOSAIC Exercises

This collection of exercises is set up for instructors to use and contribute to.

We're just getting started, but there are four main formats of exercises:

1. `.Rnw` which can be compiled by the `knitr` package in R into LaTeX
2. `.Rmd` which can be compiled by the `knitr` and `markdown` packages into HTML
3. `.Rmd` student and classroom activities.  The are fully working, scaffold documents which students are to extend.  This format provides flexibility in providing examples and guidance to students.
4. Exercises for the `ScoreR` assignment server.  Many of these are set up for automatic grading or, in the case of essay questions, electronic grading.
